        <p class="title">Does it matter to use relative size</p>
        <article>
      
            <p>

                One can get easily confused on how to make the adjustment and the calculation even about which unit to use. In this case, it is necessary to pay attention to which element the calculation refers to correspondingly. It does matter to use relative units if we need to create a flexible and scalable design. We can make our design fit as the size of the screen changes by easily adjusting its size relative to the root . In the specification the relative length units are defined as em, ex, ch and rem. These are font-relative lengths. The specification also defines a % value, which is always relative to another value. Using relative values means that things can scale up and down according to some other value. Browsers having a zooming feature is also an easy option in which browsers take the control away from developers in terms of creating their own layout. Users can go to settings and change both the font size and increase/decrease the zooming of the page. But as users keep changing the font-size and zooming, they might not get the desired output if the webpage is completely dependent on the zooming feature of the browser. The webpage can be subjected to blurred vision.
                I conclude that flexibility being added creates a comfortable reading experience when we zoom in.

                <p class="title">what does it mean when we say 200px </p>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        The computer interprets 200px in rem as 12.5rem.
                        Definition of 1rem unit is equal to the computed value of
                         font-size on the root element.
                        When specified on the font-size property of the root element, 
                        the rem units refer to the property’s initial value. 
                        When user sets different font-size on browser,
                          rem automatically scale up the down elements like fonts,
                           images etc on the webpage which is not the case with px.
                        This means that 1rem equals the font size of the html element.

<p class="title">The specific changes in css3 </p>
<article id="top" >
    CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1.<br>
     It brings a lot of new features and additions, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts.
   <ul> Css3 selectors
    <li>	CSS2.1 added pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes, and combinators. With CSS3, we can target almost any element on the page with a wide range of selectors.</li>
    <li>	CSS2 introduced several attribute selectors. These allow for matching elements based on their attributes. CSS3 expands upon those attribute selectors. Three more attribute selectors were added in CSS3; they allow for substring selection.</li>
    <li>	pseudo-classes,namely :link, :visited, :hover, :active, and :focus.A few more pseudo-class selectors were added in CSS3. One is the :root selector, which allows designers to point to the root element of a document. In HTML, it would be html. 
    Since :root is generic, it allows a designer to select the root element of an XML document without necessarily knowing it’s name.
     To permit scrollbars when needed in a document, this rule would work.</li>
    <li> A new user interaction pseudo-class selector was added, the :target selector.
         To draw the user’s attention to a span of text when the user clicks on a same-page link, 
         a rule like the first line below would work nicely; the link would look like the second line, 
         the highlighted span like the third.</li>
    
   </ul>
    <ul>	Css3 colors
    <li>	The color keyword list has been extended in the CSS3 color module to include 147 additional 
        keyword colors (that are generally well supported), CSS3 also provides us with a number of other options
        : HSL, HSLA, and RGBA. The most notable change with these new color types is the ability to declare 
        semitransparent colors.</li>
        <ul>
    <li>	RGBA :</li>
    RGBA works just like RGB, except that it adds a fourth value: alpha, the opacity level or alpha transparency level. The first three values still represent red, green, and blue. For the alpha value, 1 means fully opaque, 0 is fully transparent, and 0.5 is 50% opaque. You can use any number between 0 and 1 inclusively.
    <li>	 HSL and HSLA</li>
    HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. Unlike RGB, where you need to manipulate the saturation or brightness of a color by changing all three color values in concert, with HSL you can tweak either just the saturation or the lightness while keeping the same base hue. The syntax for HSL comprises an integer value for hue, and percentage values for saturation and lightness.
    </ul>
</ul>
    <ul>
    3.	Rounded corners
    <li>	 for images or additional markup</li>
    <li>	To add rounded corners to our box</li>
    <li> If we had wanted different-sized corners, we could declare up to four unique values</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    4.	Drop shadows
    <li>	CSS3 provides the ability to add drop shadows to elements using the box-shadow property.</li>
    <li>This property lets you specify the color, height, width, blur, and offset of one or multiple inner and/or
      outer drop shadows on your elements.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
    5.	Text shadows
    <li>	text-shadow adds shadows to individual characters in text nodes.
     Prior to CSS 3, this would be done by either using an image or duplicating a text 
     element and then positioning it.</li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
    6.	Linear gradients
    <li>	W3C added the syntax for generating linear gradients with CSS3.</li>
    <li>	You can even specify direction in degrees e.g. 60deg instead of to right</li>

    </ul>
    <ul>
    7.	Radial gradients
    <li>	Radial gradients are circular or elliptical gradients. 
    Rather than proceeding along a straight axis, colors blend out from a starting point in all directions.</li>
</ul>
    <ul>
    8.	Multiple background images
    <li>	In CSS3, there’s no need to include an element for every background image; 
    it provides us with the ability to add more than one background image to any element, even to pseudo-elements.</li>
